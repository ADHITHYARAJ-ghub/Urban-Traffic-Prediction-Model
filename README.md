# Urban-Traffic-Prediction-Model
An Urban Traffic Prediction project aims to predict traffic conditions in urban areas, leveraging historical data and various predictive modeling techniques. Accurate traffic prediction is vital for urban planning, reducing congestion, improving transportation systems.
Models used:
  Yolov5 to achieve   Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.89, Precision (P) of 0.88, and Recall (R) of 0.89, ensuring that it's ready for immediate use in your own        projects.
